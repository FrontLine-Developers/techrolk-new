        <h1 class="text-center">Refund Policy</h1>
        <p>Last updated: 23/10/2023</p>

        <h2 class="mt-3">RETURNS</h2>
        <p>Our policy lasts 3 days. If 3 days have gone by since your purchase, unfortunately we can’t offer you a
            refund or exchange.</p>

        <h2 class="mt-3">Eligibility for Return</h2>
        <p>To be eligible for a return, your item must be unused and in the same condition that you received it. It must
            also be in the original packaging.</p>
        <p>Several types of goods are exempt from being returned, mainly 3D prints and batteries cannot be returned.</p>

        <h2 class="mt-3">Non-Returnable Items</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Downloadable software products</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="mt-3">Requirements for Return</h2>
        <p>To complete your return, we require a receipt or proof of purchase.</p>
        <p>We will not accept returns if:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Any item is not in its original condition, is damaged, or missing parts for reasons not due to our
                error.</li>
            <li>Any item is returned more than 7 days after delivery.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="mt-3">Refunds</h2>
        <p>Once your return is received and inspected, we will send you an email to notify you that we have received
            your returned item. We will also notify you of the approval or rejection of your refund.</p>
        <p>If you are approved, then your refund will be processed, and a credit will automatically be applied to your
            bank account or original method of payment, within a certain amount of days.</p>

        <h2 class="mt-3">Late or Missing Refunds</h2>
        <p>If you haven’t received a refund yet, first check your bank account again. Then contact your credit card
            company; it may take some time before your refund is officially posted. Next, contact your bank. There is
            often some processing time before a refund is posted. If you’ve done all of this and you still have not
            received your refund yet, please contact us at techrolk@gmail.com.</p>

        <h2 class="mt-3">Sale Items</h2>
        <p>Only regular priced items may be refunded; unfortunately, sale items cannot be refunded.</p>

        <h2 class="mt-3">Exchanges</h2>
        <p>We only replace items if they are defective or damaged. If you need to exchange it for the same item, send us
            an email at techrolk@gmail.com and send your item to:</p>

        <p>You will be responsible for paying for your own shipping costs for returning your item. Shipping costs are
            non-refundable. If you receive a refund, the cost of return shipping will be deducted from your refund.</p>
        <p>Depending on where you live, the time it may take for your exchanged product to reach you may vary.</p>
        <p>If you are shipping an item over $75, you should consider using a trackable shipping service or purchasing
