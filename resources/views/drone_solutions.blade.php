                        When comes to a disaster event, time is critical factor to rescue victims. but when the disaster
                        happens in remote area or difficult to reach area, most of the current rescue methods from air
                        and ground tend to fail, simply due to inability to reach fast enough or less operating time. A
                        novel combined ground and areal platform (UGAV) was developed with autonomous navigation
                        capabilities. Aerial system was equipped with thrust vector mechanism system which increases
                        speed of forward motion and reduce drag due to the less tilting angle of the platform. Aero body
                        design has increased the lift force of the platform. Autonomous waypoint navigation is enabled
                        along with vision-based obstacle avoidance system. vision system is equipped with stereo camera
                        where the obstacle position is identified with it’s 2D coordinates as well as distance between
                        object and robot.

                        <h5>Ready to fly Racing/Hobby grade drones</h5>
                        These type of drones are meant for recreational flying purposes, they are assembled and
                        programmed using off the shelf components.
